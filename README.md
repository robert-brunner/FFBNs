# Cute-N-Furry

Cute-N-Furry is an all-in-one dog friend finding platform built in two consecutive week-long sprints. Users can log in and interact with their profile, edit the details about their profile and upload pictures that will then display on their page. In addition, to viewing their own profile, a dog owner can visit the swipe page where they are presented with a random dog to either like, or dislike depending attributes like interests. They can also undo a like. A user will not be able to see a match unless the corresponding profile also likes them. It uses a React front-end with a C#/.NET API and Cloudinary for image uploading.
